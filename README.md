# Rust Graph Modeling Language (GML) Parser

This is a parser for Graph Modeling Language (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language). This can efficiently read and parse GML files into a Graph data structure containing Nodes and Edges. 

Please check out the docs at: https://docs.rs/gml_parser/latest/gml_parser/


I'm open to PRs to improve this if you have ideas. 

If you can find a proper specifiation the GML grammar, that would be highly appreciated. I just made up the grammar file to best match what I understand GML to look like.
